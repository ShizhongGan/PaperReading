## Predicting the Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Chronic Diseases in Population with Human Mobility Data

### Abstract

> Understanding the distribution and progression of chronic diseases of a population is important in assisting the allocation of medical resources as well as the design of policies in preemptive healthcare.

> raditional methods to obtain large scale indicators on population health, e.g., surveys and statistical analysis, can be costly and time-consuming and often lead to a coarse spatio-temporal picture.

### 3 Disease Rate Evolution Prediction
#### 3.1 Problem Definition 

* **data processing**
1) **Human mobility records**, e.g., the check-ins dataset of Foursquare app, reflect peopleâ€™smovements in the physical world and to some extent reveal their lifestyles, which gradually affect their health conditions<br>
**Dataset description**:2010 to Dec. 2013 created at 18,018 POI venues in 426 categories, e.g., fast food restaurant, gym, park, etc. There are over 4 million check-in transition between pairs of POIs<br>

|Venues in 426 categorites\timestamp|Dec. 2010 |...| Dec. 2013|
|-----------------------------------|----------|---|----------|
|Venues 1                           |          |   |          |
|...                                |          |   |          |
|Venues 426                         |          |   |          |

2) **Chronic disease Dataset** contains the morbidity of 20 chronic diseases of 567 wards in London.

| Chronic diseases\morbidity\567wards in London|ward 1    |...| ward 567   |
|----------------------------------------------|----------|---|------------|
|Chronic diseases 1                            |          |   |            |
|...                                           |          |   |            |
|Chronic diseases 20                           |          |   |            |

* **Pearson correlation analysis**<br>
