## Predicting the Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Chronic Diseases in Population with Human Mobility Data

### Abstract

> Understanding the distribution and progression of chronic diseases of a population is important in assisting the allocation of medical resources as well as the design of policies in preemptive healthcare.

> raditional methods to obtain large scale indicators on population health, e.g., surveys and statistical analysis, can be costly and time-consuming and often lead to a coarse spatio-temporal picture.

#### 3.1 Problem Definition // data processing
1) **Human mobility records**, e.g., the check-ins dataset of Foursquare app, reflect peopleâ€™smovements in the physical world and to some extent reveal their lifestyles, which gradually affect their health conditions<br>

2)
